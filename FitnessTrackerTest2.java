/**
 * This class represents JUnit tests for 3 methods described in
 * FitnessTracker.java: testCalculateDistance(), testIndicateFitnessLevel() and
 * testCalculateCalorieDeficit().
 * 
 * Test id=1 is to test distance calculation method with assumption that user is
 * male and steps count is 5000. Delta of 0.0001 is allowed to simplify
 * calculations.
 * 
 * Test id=2 is to test if the output is either Active, Moderately Active or
 * Sedentary. The assumption was made that user did 30 active minutes and burned
 * 300 calories.
 * 
 * Test id=3 to test calories deficit/surplus calculation based on assumption
 * that user burned 900 calories and has 800 calories as a target. The purpose
 * of this test method is to be sure that burned calories are being subtracted
 * by maintenance calories to display correct information.
