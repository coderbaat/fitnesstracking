 * Class also contains methods to calculate distance based on count of steps and
 * step length depending on gender (calculateDistance()), to calculate weekly
 * active minutes based on daily active minutes (calculateWeeklyMinutes()), to
 * indicate fitness level depending on user's entered data and certain threshold
 * for calories and weekly active minutes (indicateFitnessLevel()), and to
 * calculate calories deficit based on burned calories and calories maintenance
 * level calculateCalorieDeficit.
